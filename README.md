# Time-Alarm
<p>1. The code defines a Python function called set_alarm that takes two optional parameters, minutes and seconds.</p>
<p>2. It calculates the total time in seconds based on the provided minutes and seconds.</p>
<p>3. If a valid duration is provided (greater than 0), it prints a message indicating the alarm is set, then sleeps for the specified duration using time.sleep.</p>
<p>4. After the sleep, it prints a message indicating that the time's up and the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>5. If an invalid or zero duration is provided, it prints a message prompting the user to provide a valid duration.</p>
